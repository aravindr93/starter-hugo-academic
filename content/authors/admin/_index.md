I am a Research Scientist at FAIR and a visiting post doctoral researcher at UC Berkeley. I collaborate closely and advise students in Prof. Abhinav Gupta's lab in FAIR/CMU and Prof. Pieter Abbeel's lab in UC Berkeley.

I work on algorithmic foundations of deep learning and reinforcement learning. My recent focus areas include learning from passive or offline experience, representation learning, and learning generative models for decision making. I use these algorithmic tools in applications like robotics, personalized recommendation systems, and character animation.

I recieved my PhD in CSE from the University of Washington working with Profs. Sham Kakade and Emo Todorov. During this time, I also worked closely with Sergey Levine and Chelsea Finn, and spent time as a student researcher at Google Brain and OpenAI. Before that, I recieved my Bachelors degree along with the best undergraduate thesis award from IIT Madras.
